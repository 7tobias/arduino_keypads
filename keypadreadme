Description of arduino_keypads library add-ons

folder Keypad - Mark Stanley, Alexander Brevig. arduino library

folder Keypad_I2C - Joe Young. arduino library, extension of Keypad
                    using PCF8574 I2C port chip

folder Keypad_MCP - Joe Young. arduino library, extension of Keypad
                    using MCP23008 I2C port chip

The two folders Keypad and Keypad_I2C were posted to arduino web site as
keypad.zip July 19/12, Keypad library is called version 3.0

Within each folder are the .cpp, .h, and keywords.txt files comprising the 
arduino library code, an additional folder called examples, and possibly
another folder called docs. The directory structure is such that adding
the library to the arduino environment is accomplished by placing the top
level folders (Keypad, Keypad_I2C, and/or Keypad_MCP) into the libraries
folder within the arduino sketchbook folder.

Note that the base Keypad library (for direct connection of keypads to the
arduino digital I/O pins) is posted here for completeness, but it will not
be revised by me--see comments within source files Keypad.cpp, Keypad.h.
I will be maintaining the I2C bus enhancements, possibly adding other 
keypad interfaces, and the latest version(s) will be posted here on git hub.
